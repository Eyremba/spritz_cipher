# spritz_cipher, Scala Version
A scala implementation of the Spritz sponge-like stream cipher.

This is actually the first version I wrote, as a way to get
familiar with scala.  In March 2016, I refactored the code 
so it gives you a FilterStream like the java version does.

The code itself is much nicer than the java version, however
so far the java version compiles down to a much more compact
JAR file.  It will be interesting to see what happens with
Scala 2.12.
