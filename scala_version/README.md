# spritz_cipher, Scala Version
A scala implementation of the Spritz sponge-like stream cipher.

I wrote this one before the java version, but the java version
turned out so much more compactly compiled I decided to stick
with it.  After all, I can still access it from scala code if
I want.

I'm storing the scala version here for pasterity.
